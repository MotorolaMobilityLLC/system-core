This version of init contains code to perform "bootcharting", i.e. generating log
files that can be later processed by the tools provided by www.bootchart.org.

On the emulator, use the new -bootchart <timeout> option to boot with bootcharting
activated for <timeout> seconds.

Otherwise, flash your device, and start it. Then create a file on the /data partition
with a command like the following:

  adb shell 'echo $TIMEOUT > /data/bootchart/start'

Where the value of $TIMEOUT corresponds to the wanted bootcharted period in seconds;
for example, to bootchart for 2 minutes, do:

  adb shell 'echo 120 > /data/bootchart/start'

Reboot your device, bootcharting will begin and stop after the period you gave.
You can also stop the bootcharting at any moment by doing the following:

  adb shell 'echo 1 > /data/bootchart/stop'

Note that /data/bootchart/stop is deleted automatically by init at the end of the
bootcharting. This is not the case of /data/bootchart/start, so don't forget to delete it
when you're done collecting data:

  adb shell rm /data/bootchart/start

The log files are placed in /data/bootchart/. You must run the script tools/grab-bootchart.sh
which will use ADB to retrieve them and create a bootchart.tgz file that can be used with
the bootchart parser/renderer, or even uploaded directly to the form located at:

  http://www.bootchart.org/download.html

NOTE: the bootchart.org webform doesn't seem to work at the moment, you can generate an
      image on your machine by doing the following:

         1/ download the sources from www.bootchart.org
         2/ unpack them
         3/ in the source directory, type 'ant' to build the bootchart program
         4/ type 'java -jar bootchart.jar /path/to/bootchart.tgz

technical note:

This implementation of bootcharting does not use the 'bootchartd' script provided by
www.bootchart.org, but a C re-implementation that is directly compiled into our init
program.
