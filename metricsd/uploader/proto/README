This directory contains the protocol buffers used by the standalone metrics
uploader. Those protobuffers are copied from the chromium protobuffers from
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/metrics/proto/
at 3bfe5f2b4c03d2cac718d137ed14cd2c6354bfed.

Any change to this protobuf must first be made to the backend's protobuf and be
compatible with the chromium protobuffers.


Q: Why fork the chromium protobuffers ?
A: The standalone metrics uploader needs chromium os fields that are not defined
by the chromium protobufs. Instead of pushing chromium os specific changes to
chromium, we can add them only to chromium os (and to the backend of course).


Q: What's the difference between those protobuffers and chromium's protobuffers?
A: When the protobuffers were copied, some chromium specific protobuffers were
not imported:
* omnibox related protobuffers.
* performance profiling protobuffers (not used in chromium os).
