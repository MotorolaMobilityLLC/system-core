logd.auditd.dmesg           bool  true   selinux audit messages duplicated and
                                         sent on to dmesg log
logd.dgram_qlen.statistics  bool  false  Record dgram_qlen statistics. This
                                         represents a performance impact and
                                         is used to determine the platform's
                                         minimum domain socket network FIFO
                                         size (see source for details) based
                                         on typical load (logcat -S)
