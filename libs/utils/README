Android Utility Function Library

If you need a feature that is native to Linux but not present on other
platforms, construct a platform-dependent implementation that shares
the Linux interface.  That way the actual device runs as "light" as
possible.

If that isn't feasible, create a system-independent interface and hide
the details.

The ultimate goal is *not* to create a super-duper platform abstraction
layer.  The goal is to provide an optimized solution for Linux with
reasonable implementations for other platforms.
