/**
 * A set of bit masks for specifying how the received preview frames are
 * handled before the previewCallback() call.
 *
 * The least significant 3 bits of an "int" value are used for this purpose:
 *
 * ..... 0 0 0
 *       ^ ^ ^
 *       | | |---------> determine whether the callback is enabled or not
 *       | |-----------> determine whether the callback is one-shot or not
 *       |-------------> determine whether the frame is copied out or not
 *
 * WARNING: When a frame is sent directly without copying, it is the frame
 * receiver's responsiblity to make sure that the frame data won't get
 * corrupted by subsequent preview frames filled by the camera. This flag is
 * recommended only when copying out data brings significant performance price
 * and the handling/processing of the received frame data is always faster than
 * the preview frame rate so that data corruption won't occur.
 *
 * For instance,
 * 1. 0x00 disables the callback. In this case, copy out and one shot bits
 *    are ignored.
 * 2. 0x01 enables a callback without copying out the received frames. A
 *    typical use case is the Camcorder application to avoid making costly
 *    frame copies.
 * 3. 0x05 is enabling a callback with frame copied out repeatedly. A typical
 *    use case is the Camera application.
 * 4. 0x07 is enabling a callback with frame copied out only once. A typical
 *    use case is the Barcode scanner application.
